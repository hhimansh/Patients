# Patients
There is a patients database, based on which MVC was implemented.
Ran the scafolding command and created models and views(for each action) based on the tables in DB
Created controllers with views
Added keys in every view (create, edit, delete, details, index) with key being editable only in create view.
Added links to 5 controllers in the nav bar
